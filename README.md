# Pico Tutorial Projects

This repository contains implementations of Raspberry Pi Pico W tutorial projects using the Pico C SDK. These projects
are based on
the [Freenove Ultimate Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi Pico](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi_Pico),
but have been adapted to use the official
[Raspberry Pi Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) instead of the Arduino IDE. Each project is contained
in its own directory, with a CMakeLists.txt file for building with the Pico SDK.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that some projects have been implemented with modifications or additional features and do not exactly
> match the original Freenove examples.
