# Pico Tutorial Projects

This repository contains implementations of Raspberry Pi Pico W tutorial projects using the Pico C SDK. These projects
are based on the Freenove Ultimate Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi Pico[^1], but have been adapted to use the official
Raspberry Pi Pico SDK[^2] instead of the Arduino IDE. Each project is contained in its own directory, with a
CMakeLists.txt file for building with the Pico SDK.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that some projects have been implemented with modifications or additional features and do not exactly
> match the original Freenove examples.
